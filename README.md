## 📌 Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **longitudinal analysis** of HIV-related indicators across **47 African countries** from **2000 to 2023**. The study was independently conceptualized, coded, analyzed, and visualized by the author using R, and is currently under review at the *European Journal of Epidemiology* (2023 IF: 7.7 | 5-Year IF: 9.8).

## 🧪 Objective

To examine the trends and relationships between:

- **HIV Incidence Rate**
- **ART Coverage (%)**
- **AIDS-Related Mortality Rate**

...across African countries, and identify regional patterns and epidemiological insights using reproducible data science workflows.
