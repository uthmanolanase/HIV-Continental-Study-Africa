## 📌 Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **longitudinal analysis** of HIV-related indicators across **47 African countries** from **2000 to 2023**. The study was independently conceptualized, coded, analyzed, and visualized by the author using R, and is currently under review at the *European Journal of Epidemiology* (2023 IF: 7.7 | 5-Year IF: 9.8).

## 🧪 Objective

To examine the trends and relationships between:

- **HIV Incidence Rate**
- **ART Coverage (%)**
- **AIDS-Related Mortality Rate**

...across African countries, and identify regional patterns and epidemiological insights using reproducible data science workflows.

## 📂 Data Sources

- [UNAIDS](https://aidsinfo.unaids.org/)
- [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/data)
- [World Bank DataBank](https://databank.worldbank.org/)

> 📝 Note: Africa comprises 54 countries, but only 47 had complete or partial records across the variables studied.

## 🔧 Methods

- **Data Wrangling:** Cleaning, merging, reshaping, and handling missing data  
- **Imputation:** Scientific midpoint approximation for values represented as ranges (e.g., "<200")  
- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Pearson correlation
  - Linear regression
  - Multiple linear regression  
- **Visualizations:**
  - Line plots of longitudinal trends
  - Scatter plots for bivariate comparisons
  - Bar charts for cross-country comparisons
